The Python driver for Firebird
##############################

The `firebird-driver` package provides official `Python Database API 2.0`_-compliant driver
for the open source relational database `Firebird`_ ®. In addition to the minimal feature
set of the standard Python DB API, this driver also exposes the new (interface-based) client
API introduced in Firebird 3, and number of additional extensions and enhancements for
convenient use of Firebird RDBMS.

This documentation set is not a tutorial on SQL or Firebird; rather, it is a topical
presentation of driver's feature set, with example code to demonstrate basic usage patterns.
For detailed information about Firebird features, see the
`Firebird documentation <http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/documentation/>`__, and especially
the excellent `The Firebird Book <http://www.ibphoenix.com/products/books/firebird_book>`__
written by Helen Borrie and published by IBPhoenix_.

.. seealso:: `firebird-lib`_ package for optional extensions to this driver.

.. note:: Requires Python 3.8+

.. tip:: You can download docset for Dash_ (MacOS) or Zeal_ (Windows / Linux) documentation
   readers from releases_ at github.
