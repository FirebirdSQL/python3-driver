Version 1.2.0

  Default mode is TO_EOF.

* Important: Support for Firebird 4 TIMEZONE is broken (for FB4 RC1). It will be fixed in
  next driver version.

* Various changes to documentation and type hint adjustments.
* Changed: `.DriverConfig.db_defaults` and `.DriverConfig.server_defaults` are now created
  as `optional` (introduced by firebird-base 1.2.0), so configuration file does not require
  `firebird.db.defaults` and `firebird.server.defaults` sections (even empty).
* Fix: unregistered bug in `InfoProvider`.
